The purpose of this NLG service is to generate short textual descriptions of resources from RDF metadata saved in a tripple store repository.

The service is configured via 2 files:
1.  Ontologies.xml which contains information about ontologies used by the NLG service (name, name space and path to the ontology file)
2.  nlgService.properties which contains paths to the lexicon files and the ontologies.xml file, and information about the Sesame server.

By default, those configuration files point to the folders of the test package (./test/lexicon and ./test/ontologies)
